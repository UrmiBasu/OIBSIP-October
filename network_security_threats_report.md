Task 4: Research Report on Common Network Security Threats

**Analysing Network Security Threats and The Countermeasures**

With our present world becoming more interconnected than ever, cybersecurity has become even more essential than ever. From leaking private data to network breaching in whole countries, cyber threats never stop innovating. Three of the most common network security threats are Denial-of-Service attack, Man-in-the-Middle attack, and Spoofing. Knowing the working of these and measures to avoid them is very important for businesses, IT experts, and regular users.

**Denial-of-Service Attack**

A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is said to be made when the attacker sends uncontrolled traffic to a network, server, or website, making it impotent of responding to actual requests. Stealing data isn't the goal, but making services unavailable and producing unproductive times. In a more advanced form known as a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack, the traffic is obtained from several machines, generally computers which are hacked(a botnet), which makes blocking very tough.

How It Works:

1. Malicious users create excessive requests to a targeted server.  
2. The server gets full and either becomes slower or breaks down.  
3. Valid users are stopped from getting the services.

Its Impact:

1. Website or application crash  
2. Loss of money and customer faith  
3. High costs for recovery

A Real-World Example:

In the year 2016, the DNS host, Dyn, faced a great DDoS attack that stopped access to popular and relevant sites namely Twitter, Netflix, Reddit & PayPal. The attack was done using the Mirai botnet, which targeted IoT devices like routers and cameras.

Countermeasures users can apply:

1. Application of firewalls and intrusion prevention systems to check unusual traffic.  
2. Use rate limiting to make a limit of the volume of requests from a single source.  
3. Apply DDoS protection services like Cloudflare.  
4. Continuously check traffic for anomalies.

**Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**

A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack happens when the attacker privately intervenes and also changes the communication between two users who think they're communicating directly with each other.

How It Works:

1. The attacker is present in between the sender and the receiver.  
2. The attacker is able to listen, take information, or put in harmful data.  
3. The affected users generally do not even get to know that their communication has been interrupted.

Its Impact:

1. Theft of confidential content (for example: login information, credit card number)  
2. Increasing online frauds and scams.  
3. Lack of data security.

A Real-World Example:

Comodo, which was a certificate authority, was hacked in the year 2011, and false SSL certificates were released for relevant sites such as Google, Yahoo & Skype. These could have helped attackers to interrupt secure communications hiding behind the names of websites trusted by all.

Countermeasures users can apply:

1. Apply HTTPS & SSL/TLS encryption for every traffic.  
2. Don't use public Wi-Fi for private transactions if VPN is not available.  
3. Apply robust authentication like Multi-Factor Authentication.  
4. Apply certificate pinning to prevent copying of certificates.

**Spoofing Attacks**

Spoofing means imitation attacks where the attacker imitates a trustworthy system. There are three kinds of spoofing, namely:

1. IP Spoofing: Imitating an IP address so as to look like a trust-worthy source.  
2. Email Spoofing: Copying email headers to cheat recipients  
3. DNS Spoofing: Altering DNS records to shift users to imitated websites.

How It Works:

1. The attacker does not show their identity or originality of the communication.  
2. Affected users contact the attacker, believing it's a secure source.  
3. The attacker collects confidential data or spreads malware.

Its Impact:

1. Users are tricked into revealing passwords or downloading malware.  
2. Companies face data leak and loss of reputation.  
3. Monetary loss by phishing and scam.

A Real-World Example:

In 2014, Sony Pictures was hacked and the reason is said to be a phishing email which is a kind of spoofing. Attackers broke into intrinsic connections and leaked confidential information, like movies yet to release and employee data. 

Countermeasures users can apply:

1. Apply email verification systems like SPF, DKIM & DMARC.  
2. Teach users the identification of phishing and distrustful emails.  
3. Apply DNS security extensions to stop DNS spoofing.  
4. Use network access controls to stop spoofed packets.

**Conclusion**

Cyber attacks such as DoS, MITM, and spoofing are not imaginary and have been seen to destroy and affect individuals as well as organizations. The good part is that all of these attacks can be hugely eliminated with a combination of technology, guidance, and precaution.

Key Takeaways:

1. Stay updated on the new threats coming up.  
2. Use strong encryption and authentication measures.  
3. Train users, human factor is usually the weakest part.  
4. Put in money for network monitoring and threat detection systems.

In security, prevention is always better than cure. Being active instead of being reactive can avoid or stop millions of losses and secure the faith of users and clients.
