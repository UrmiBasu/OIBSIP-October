Task 5: Research Report on Social Engineering Attacks

**Understanding Social Engineering Attacks**

Social engineering attacks misuse an individuals' psychology to make them reveal private information or do actions that lessens security. They generally bypass even the most robust technical control systems as they exploit the most unstable part of any security system: humans.

The main types of social engineering attacks are:

1. **Phishing**: Fake emails and messages that try to trick users to click on harmful links or give personal content.

2. **Spear Phishing**: A personalised type of phishing, in which the scammers target their message to a particular user or group of users.

3. **Whaling / Business Email Compromise**: Attacking high-level executives or finance officials, usually to carry out deceitful transactions.

4. **Pretexting**: The attacker imitates a legal-like pretext for the theft of data or to get permission to enter a system \- for example, acting as an auditor or an IT technician.

5. **Baiting**: Attracting users with something valuable (for example, free USB drive, free software download) that contains malware or backdoors.

6. **Other Variants**: Voice phishing, SMS phishing and QR code phishing.

**Real-World Case Studies & Impact**

**Case Study 1: Facebook & Google Invoice Scam**

A Lithuanian cybercriminal claimed to be a valid seller and made Facebook and Google do payments of more than $100 million.  
Impact: Huge loss of money, some of which was recovered later on.  
Why it worked: Faith in seller relationships, inadequate multi-step permission for huge transactions.

**Case Study 2: FACC (Austria) Executive Email Scam**

Attackers called the CEO's email number and asked a finance employee to transfer cash for a false purchase causing a loss of $61 million.  
Impact: Monetary loss and staff disturbance.  
Why it worked: Blind faith in authority, sense of emergency lacking, no adequate confirmation of the request made.

**Case Study 3: Crelan Bank Business Email Compromise**

Similar to the FACC case, attackers falsely claimed to be the executive and requested a fake transfer causing a loss of €75.8 million.  
Impact: Monetary loss, process revamp.  
Why it worked: Absence of two-factor verification for monetary requests.

**Case Study 4: Xoom Corporation Phishing**

Phishing emails to finance department had cost the company a loss of $30.8 million. The stock had dropped by 14%.  
Impact: Monetary loss, reputation affected.  
Why it worked: Very low internal control over transaction verifications.

**Case Study 5: M\&S / Harrods Service Desk Exploits (2025)**

Scammers phished service desk people into impairing multi-factor authentication to gain entry to confidential systems.  
Impact: Huge operational disturbance, stopped online sales, damage of reputation.  
Why it worked: Human error in service communications which were trusted, no security practices on password altering.

**Why These Attacks Work**:

1. Authority and Trust: Employees get obedient when requests claim to be from the management authorities .  
2. Urgency: Attackers apply pressure, which restricts the person's ability to think logically.  
3. Familiarity: They imitate language, voice, and other factors of internal conversations.  
4. Process Gaps: Most organizations dont have strict controls on authenticating strange requests.  
5. Technology Over-Dependence: Firewalls and antivirus applications cannot find an employee who voluntarily discloses information.

**Prevention Recommendations**

For the prevention of social engineering, we need a multi-layered system, combining people, processes along with technology.

* **Continuous Employee Training**

1. Do phishing campaigns like simulation to make employees more observant.  
2. Teach employees to identify red flags (strange emails, weird attachments, etc).  
3. Look for psychological triggers: emergency, fright and authority imitation.  
     
* **Strong Verification Processes**

1. Ask for subordinate approvals too, on valuable transactions.  
2. Always check doubtful requests on another communication channel (like a phone call).  
3. Don’t act as per the instructions given by the email only.

* **Multi-Factor Authentication**

1. Apply MFA wherever possible, specially for the users with extra advantages.  
2. Choose app-based or hardware tokens over MFA based on SMS.

* **Least Advantage and Access Based on roles**

1. Stop entry to confidential systems and content on a role-by-role way.  
2. Routinely check access records.

* **Safeguard Access and Control of Assets through Service Desk Processes**

1. Stop resetting passwords or changing MFA if not having a strong identity verification.  
2. Use change request policies no matter whether a person appears valid or not.

* **Technical Safeguards**

1. Use anti-phishing applications, filters for spams and anomaly detection.  
2. Apply web filtering to stop the access to known harmful sites.  
3. Check network traffic for strange acts.

* **Incident Response Plans**

1. Build decorum on handling social engineering instances.  
2. Usual practice scenarios to experiment the organization's strength.

* **Password Hygiene**

1. Carry out robust password rules.  
2. Stop using multiple platforms again and again.  
3. Enforce password managers.

**Conclusion & Summary**

Social engineering attacks won't go away, they will transform and evolve with technology. The worst part is that they don't need to break into  systems, they just need to cheat an individual.

**Takeaways:**

1. The weakest link is most likely the human, and the bad guys learned how to misuse that.  
2. Learning and suspicion are your greatest first-line of defense.  
3. Technical and process safeguards will assist people in making the right decisions.  
4. Multi-layered defense mechanisms are the only practical way of combating such attacks.

All organizations, big or small, in any sector, must consider social engineering as a high-threat priority. It can be prevented to a great extent by having proper culture, procedures, and tools.
